\section{\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19010}{Phase evolution of strong field Ionization}}

\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Andrew Brown}
We investigate the time-dependent evolution of the dipole phase shift induced by strong-field ionisation (SFI) using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) for time-delays where the pump-probe pulses overlap. We study measured and calculated time-dependent ATA spectra of the ionic $4d\rightarrow5p$ in xenon, and present the time-dependent line shape parameters in the complex plane. We attribute the complex dynamics to the contribution of three distinct processes: accumulation of ionisation, transient population and retrapping of excited states  arising from polarisation of the ground state.
