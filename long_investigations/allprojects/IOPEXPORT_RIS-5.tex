}}

\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Myrta Grüning}


We present a Floquet scheme for the ab-initio calculation of nonlinear optical properties in extended systems. This entails a reformulation of the real-time approach based on the dynamical Berry-phase polarisation (Attaccalite and Grüning 2013 Phys. Rev. B 88 1–9) and retains the advantage of being non-perturbative in the electric field. The proposed method applies to periodically-driven Hamiltonians and makes use of this symmetry to turn a time-dependent problem into a self-consistent time-independent eigenvalue problem. We implemented this Floquet scheme at the independent particle level and compared it with the real-time approach. Our reformulation reproduces real-time-calculated 2nd and 3rd order susceptibilities for a number of bulk and two-dimensional materials, while reducing the associated computational cost by one or two orders of magnitude.
