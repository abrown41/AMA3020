}}

\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Lisa McFetridge}


No previous studies have validated current clinical practice guidelines for the management of non-blanching rashes in children who have received meningococcal B and C vaccinations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of existing clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis of invasive meningococcal disease in children presenting with a fever and non-blanching rash in the UK.
