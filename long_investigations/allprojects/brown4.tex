\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Andrew Brown}
We report on calculations of harmonic generation by neon in a mixed (800-nm + time-delayed 400-nm) laser pulse scheme. In contrast with previous studies we employ a short (few-cycle) 400-nm pulse, finding that this affords control of the interference between electron trajectories contributing to the cutoff harmonics. The inclusion of the 400-nm pulse enhances the yield and cutoff energy, both of which exhibit a strong dependence on the time delay between the two pulses. Using a combination of time-dependent R-matrix theory and a classical trajectory model, we assess the mechanisms leading to these effects.
