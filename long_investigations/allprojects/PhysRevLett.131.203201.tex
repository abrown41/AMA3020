\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Andrew Brown}



Multiphoton light-matter interactions invoke a so-called “black box” in which the experimental observations contain the quantum interference between multiple pathways. Here, we employ polarization-controlled attosecond photoelectron metrology with a partial wave manipulator to deduce the pathway interference within this quantum ‘black box” for the two-photon ionization of neon atoms. The angle-dependent and attosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectra are measured across a broad energy range. Two-photon phase shifts for each partial wave are reconstructed through the comprehensive analysis of these photoelectron spectra. We resolve the quantum interference between the degenerate p → d → p and p → s → p two-photon ionization pathways, in agreement with our theoretical simulations. Our approach thus provides an attosecond time-resolved microscope to look inside the “black box” of pathway interference in ultrafast dynamics of atoms, molecules, and condensed matter.
