\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Andrew Brown}
We have developed the capability to determine accurate harmonic spectra for
multielectron atoms within time-dependent R-matrix (TDRM) theory. Harmonic
spectra can be calculated using the expectation value of the dipole length,
velocity or acceleration operator. We assess the calculation of the harmonic
spectrum from He irradiated by 390 nm laser light with intensities up to
$4\times10^{14}$Wcm$^{-2}$ using each form, including the influence of the multielectron basis used in
the TDRM code. The spectra are consistent between the diﬀerent forms, although
the dipole acceleration calculation breaks down at lower harmonics. The results
obtained from TDRM theory are compared with results from the HELIUM code finding
good quantitative agreement between the methods. We find that bases which
include pseudostates give the best comparison with the HELIUM code, but models
comprising only physical orbitals also produce accurate results.
