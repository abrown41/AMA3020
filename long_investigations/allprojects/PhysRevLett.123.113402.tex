\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Gleb Gribakin}



A model-potential approach has been developed to study positron interactions with molecules. Binding energies and annihilation rates are calculated for positron bound states with a range of alkane molecules, including rings and isomers. The calculated binding energies are in good agreement with experimental data, and the existence of a second bound state for $n$-alkanes (C$_n$ H$_{2n+2}$) with $n\geq12$ is predicted in accord with experiment. The annihilation rate for the ground positron bound state scales linearly with the square root of the binding energy.
