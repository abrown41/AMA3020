\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Timi Alakoya}
In this paper, we study several classes of split inverse problems. We start with the split common
fixed point problem with multiple output sets for multivalued demicontractive mappings. A relaxed inertial
iterative method for solving this problem is presented and analysed. Furthermore, the method is applied to a
system of split variational inequalities, system of split equilibrium problem and other related split problems.
Several numerical experiments illustrate and validate the applicability of our proposed method.
