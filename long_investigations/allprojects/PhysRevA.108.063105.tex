\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Andrew Brown}

We propose a novel scheme for resolving the contribution of inner- and outer-valence electrons in extreme-ultraviolet (XUV)-initiated high-harmonic generation in neon. By probing the atom with a low-energy (below the $2s$ ionization threshold) ultrashort XUV pulse, the $2p$ electron is steered away from the core, while the $2s$ electron is enabled to describe recollision trajectories. By selectively suppressing the $2p$ recollision trajectories, we can resolve the contribution of the $2s$ electron to the high-harmonic spectrum. We apply the classical trajectory model to account for the contribution of the $2s$ electron, which allows for an intuitive understanding of the process.
