\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Timi Alakoya}
In this study, we introduce and investigate a new class of split inverse problems, comprising a multidimensional parameter of evolution, which we call the multidimensional split variational inequality problem with multiple output sets. To demonstrate its applicability, we formulate the equilibrium flow of multidimensional traffic network models for an arbitrary number of locations. We define a multidimensional split Wardrop condition with multiple output sets and establish its equivalence with the formulated equilibrium flow of multidimensional traffic network models. We then establish the existence and uniqueness of equilibria for our proposed model. In addition, we propose a method for solving the introduced problem. We then validate our results using some numerical experiments.
