\subsection*{Supervisor: Dr Gleb Gribakin}


Enhanced positron annihilation on polyatomic molecules is a long-standing and complex problem. We report the results of calculations of resonant positron annihilation on methyl halides. A free parameter of our theory is the positron binding energy. A comparison with energy-resolved annihilation rates measured for CH$_3$F, CH$_3$Cl, and CH$_3$Br [L. D. Barnes et al., Phys. Rev. A 74, 012706 (2006)] shows good agreement and yields estimates of the binding energies.
