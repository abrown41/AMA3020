\subsection*{Supervisor: Prof Connor Ballance}



Electron-impact scattering data for argon and its ions continue to be of interest in studies of magnetically confined plasmas. In an earlier paper, Griffin et al (1997 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 30 3543) employed the results of 28-term and 40-term R-matrix calculations of electron-impact excitation in Ar+ to carry out a collisional-radiative modelling study of the impurity influx of argon in tokamaks. We have now completed a 452-term R-matrix with pseudo-states (RMPS) calculation of electron-impact excitation for Ar+ in order to provide more accurate excitation data; using these improved data, we have repeated the modelling studies presented in the earlier paper. We compare our excitation data, as well as the results of the collisional radiative calculations, with those arising from the 40-term R-matrix calculation and find significant differences.
