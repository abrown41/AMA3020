There are two jugs of equal volume, one containing coffee and one milk. You take one cup of milk, pour it in the jug of coffee and mix. Then you take one cup from the mixture and pour it back into the jug of milk. 
\\
Prove that the amount of milk in the jug of coffee is the same as the amount of coffee in the jug of milk. Discuss the assumptions to arrive at this conclusion.
\\
\\
Now consider again the two jugs, one of pure milk and one of pure coffee. By transferring back and forth a cup of liquid from the first to the second jug and vice versa, is it possible to obtain two equal mixtures, i.e. two jugs containing each half coffee--half milk?
\\
\\
Discuss extensions to the problems, for instance, 3 jugs (coffee, milk and hot-chocolate), jugs of different sizes....
