Consider a planar mechanism which consists of three bars connected by joints (see diagram). Bars $OA$ and $O'B$ (called cranks) are free to rotate about fixed points $O$ and $O'$, respectively. Find how the coordinates of point $C$ depend on the angle $\phi$ that rod $OA$ makes with the line $O'O$. Explore how the shape of the path described by point $C$ depends on the lengths of the cranks $a$ and $b$, and lengths $c$ and $d$, taking them as fractions of the length l between points $O$ and $O'$.
In particular, if this mechanism is to model the motion of a foot, find the optimal lengths that would make point $C$ move in a curve, part of which is close to a straight line (foot in contact with the ground), the other part being an arc-like path of the foot though the air.
