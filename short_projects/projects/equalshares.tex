Suppose we have six non-graduated jugs of different sizes which can contain
respectively 3, 5, 8, 11, 13 and 24 units of liquid.
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item How, using only the 3, 5 and 8 unit jugs, does one divide 8 units into
two equal parts?
\item How, using the 11, 13 and 24 unit jugs, does one divide 24 units into
equal parts?
\item Can you generalise this to jugs holding $a$, $b$ and $c$ units?
\item Suppose we now have jugs holding 5, 8, 13 and 26 units, with the 8 and
13 unit jugs initially full. How do you divide the 21 units into 3 equal parts?
\end{itemize}
