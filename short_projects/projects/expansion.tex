\section{Expanding a number as a sum of powers\\ \small{(%Pathway: Any; 
Pre-requisite: None)}}

Certain numbers $N$ can be
written as
\[
N = 2^a + 3^b + 5^c,
\]
where $a,$ $b$ and $c$ are whole numbers. For example, 18 can be written as
$18 = 2^4+3^0+5^0$. It can also be written as $18 = 2^2+3^2+5^1$. Comparing
these two different ways, we see that none of the parameters $a$, 
$b$ and $c$ remains the same in these different ways of representing 18.
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the largest number that you can find that can be written in two
completely distinct ways? Note, all three parameters $a$, $b$ and $c$ must
differ.
\item What is the largest number that you can find that can be written in three
completely distinct ways? 
\item Can you prove that there is a maximum number of ways $N$ can be
written as $2^a + 3^b + 5^c$? (Here, not all parameters ($a$, $b$ or $c$)
need to differ). 
\item Expand (for example, to $2^a + 3^b + 5^c + 7^d$).\\

\end{itemize}
