\section{Bouncing ball\\ \small{(%Pathway: AMA; 
Pre-requisite: Classical mechanics)}}
A small ball is released from rest from a point above a large sphere
of radius $R$. If this point lies on the vertical line through the centre
of the sphere, the ball will keep bouncing along this line. However, if the
point is some distance $d$ away from this line ($d<R$), the ball will
bounce off at an angle after colliding with the sphere. In this case it will
only make a finite number of bounces on the spherical surface, before
jumping off it.\\[6pt]
Estimate the number of times the ball will bounce off the sphere.
[You may assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic. It might be
easier to find an estimate for $d\ll R$. However, an exact (numerical?)
solution may also be possible in the general case.]
