%\underline{\large\bf Stiff differential equations} \\[0.1cm]
Many differential equations that are of importance in mathematics and its
applications can only be solved numerically. In this case one must ensure that
the solution obtained is {\em accurate}. In particular, errors can occur when
solutions contain terms that decrease rapidly. This problem can be illustrated
by the following equation
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{dx}{dt} = -30x,
\end{displaymath}
that needs to be solved with the initial conditions $x(0)=1$.
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Calculate the estimated value of $x(h)$ using a single step of the
Runge-Kutta method of order 4 for various step sizes $h$ and compare with the
exact result.
\item Use the scipy differential equation solver {\tt vode}
with integrator option {\tt `bdf'} (stiff problems) and {\tt `adams'} (non-stiff problems) to find numerical
solutions and compare them with the exact result.
\item Repeat the last two steps for
\begin{displaymath}
\dot x=-20x+20\sin \omega t + \omega \cos \omega t
\end{displaymath}
What happens for $\omega =0.02$? What happens for other values of $\omega $?
\end{itemize}
