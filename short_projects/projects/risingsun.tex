The number of hours of daylight varies with the time of the year and is
different at different latitudes, because the axis of rotation of the Earth
is not perpendicular to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. (The
axial tilt is $\alpha =23.5^\circ $.) Devise a method that allows one to
determine the length of daylight at any point on the Earth's surface at
any time of the year.\\[6pt]
Can you also find the times of sunrises and sunsets?
