The damped, driven oscillator obeys the equation of motion
\begin{displaymath}
\ddot{x}+ b\dot{x} + \sin x  =  a \cos \omega t,
\end{displaymath}
where $a$, $b$ and $\omega$ are constants. For small displacements, i.e.,
$|x|\ll 1$, one has $\sin x\simeq x$, and this equation can be solved
analytically. For large
$x$, however, this nonlinear differential cannot be solved analytically, but
it can be solved numerically. The solutions of this equation have some very
surprising properties for appropriate values of $a$, $b$ and $\omega$.\\[6pt]
Give an account of the different types of motion possible for this system.
[This problem can be investigated numerically using python.]
