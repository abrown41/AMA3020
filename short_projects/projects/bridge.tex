%Optimal paths through trellis networks
Alice, Bob, Chris and Diana want to cross a bridge at night. The bridge is not
lit, but they have one torch amongst them. However, only at most two people
can cross the bridge at the same time and the torch is needed to cross the
bridge. Furthermore, Alice takes 20 minutes, and Bob 25, whereas Chris and
Diana only need 5 and 10 minutes, respectively. What is the shortest time it
takes for all four of them to cross the bridge?\\[6pt]
Can you think of a general approach to solving this problem? How would this
general approach work when Eve has to cross the bridge as well, and would
take 15 minutes to do so?\\[6pt]
One systematic way in which this problem can be solved is through trellis
graphs. Trellis networks play an important role in communication technology,
and are also used in algorithms, for example,  for finding most likely
sequences in hidden Markov models. Trellis networks can, for example, be
used for error correction techniques in digital communication through
so-called Viterbi decoding. An introduction to Viterbi decoding can be
found in many textbooks; a detailed example of such decoding is given in
[1].\\[6pt]
