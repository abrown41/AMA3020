\section{Narrow escape\\ \small{(%Pathway: Any; 
Pre-requisite: None)}}
%man and dog
A circular field is surrounded by a fence. A man standing in the
centre of the field can run with speed $v$. A dog can run along the fence
with speed $u=4v$. Will the man be able to escape, i.e., reach a point
in the fence before the dog gets there? (The dog and the man can
see each other at all times, and the dog is doing its best to catch the man.)
What strategy/path should the man follow?\\[6pt]
What is the maximum ratio $u/v$ for the which the man can escape? If the ratio
is greater than this, where can the man be at the start, relative to the dog, so
that he can still escape?
