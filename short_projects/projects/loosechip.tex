%\underline{\large\bf Loose Chippings} \\[0.1cm]
Many local authorities recommend that car drivers limit the speed of the car
to 20~mph when travelling over roads which have been newly surfaced with
bituminous binder and stone chippings. The advisory limit is intended to
avoid the situation where loose stones lifted by the rear wheels of a vehicle
in front fly into the path of your vehicle and can cause damage to paintwork
or even break the windscreen.\\[6pt]
Investigate whether this is a reasonable speed limit, given that the
vehicles are separated by a distance recommended by the Highway Code (i.e.,
a two-second gap).

You may assume that relative to the vehicle the stones are projected with the
speed of the vehicle,
%that the flying stones remain in the vertical plane containing the motion of
%the vehicle, that vehicles travel at constant speed, 
that air resistance is negligble and that drivers are only worried about
stones hitting the front of the bonnet (typically 0.75 metres above the
ground). Any other assumptions which you make should be stated clearly.
