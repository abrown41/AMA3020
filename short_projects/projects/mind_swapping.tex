\section{Minds swapping\\ \small{(%Pathway: Any; 
Pre-requisite: None)}}
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, four friends, Amy, Bob, Charlie and David found a strange device capable of swapping the minds of the two people using it. At first the group find it amusing, in fact Amy swapped with Bob, Charlie swapped with David and finally Amy (in Bob's body) swapped with Charlie.
\\ \\
Unfortunately, they soon realised that the device would not swap back a pair that already used the device.
Can the 4 friends swap back their minds to their original bodies?
\\ \\
Two other friends Eliza and Francis go and help their four friends. Is there a sequence of swaps that brings everybody to their original bodies avoiding a pair using the device twice?
\\ \\
Can the problem be solved when $N$ bodies are shuffled?\\
 How many swaps are needed?
\\ Discuss possible extensions.
