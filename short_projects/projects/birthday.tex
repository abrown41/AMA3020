\item [(a)]It is well-known that 23 is the smallest number of people in a
group for which the probability that at least two of them have the same
birthday is greater than 0.5. Prove this result.
\item [(b)] How many people must you query so that the probability of finding at
least one with {\em your} birthday is more than 0.5?
\item [(c)] What is the relationship between the situations in (a) and (b)?
\item [(d)] If the group in (a) consisted of equal numbers of men and women,
what is the minimum group size if the pair sharing the common birthday is a
man and a woman?
\item [(e)] Extend.
