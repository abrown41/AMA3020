%\underline{\large \bf Cycling into the wind}\\[0.1cm]
It often seems that you are more likely to cycle into the wind than to have the
wind in your back. While cynics may say that this is a purely psychological
effect of the effort you make to overcome the wind, good modelling
suggest that the effect is due to air resistance.
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Assume that the air is a collection of particles which move in the same
direction and the same (wind) speed. How does the air resistance depend on
the wind speed, the cyclist's speed and the angle between the direction
of the wind and that of the cyclist?

\item If a cyclist can reach a speed of 20 mph in the absence of any wind, and
25 mph with wind fully in the back, what maximum speed will the cyclist reach
in full headwind? What speed can be reached for other wind directions?

\item What effect does resistance due to the road surface have?

\end{itemize}
