\title{\bf AMA3020 Short Investigations}
\author{Connor Ballance and Mauro Paternostro} 
\date{\today}
\maketitle

Guidance will be provided by Dr Ballance and Prof Paternostro.
Topics chosen for the pair investigations will generally not be available for the solo investigations.
In a large class, some projects will probably be chosen by more than one
pair or more than one student. However, we would like the class to do as
many {\it different} projects as possible. Although your preferences will be
taken into account, there is no guarantee that you will always be assigned
a project of your first choice.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
\underline{\bf The Dirac delta function and entropy of harmonic oscillators} \hfill {\em Dr.\ Alavi} 
\\[0.1cm]
The Dirac delta function $\delta(x)$ appears in many branches of mathematical physics.  It has a number of
formal properties, including
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta(x) & = & 0 \hspace*{0.5cm} (x \neq 0) \\[0.2cm]
\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} \delta(x) ~  dx & = & 1 \\[0.2cm]
\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} \delta(x-x_0) ~ f(x)~ dx & = & f(x_0) \\[0.2cm]
\delta(f(x)) & = & \left| \frac{df(x)}{dx} \right| ^{-1} \delta(x-x_0) 
\end{eqnarray}
where in the last formula $x_0$ is chosen so that $f(x_0)$=0.  We are going to use the Dirac delta function
to evaluate the entropy of a system of harmonic oscillators. \\[0.2cm]
Consider an $N$ dimensional harmonic oscillator with the following Hamiltonian
\begin{displaymath}
H ~ = ~ \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i^2}{2} ~ + ~ \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{x_i^2}{2}
\end{displaymath}
where $\{x_i\}$ are the coordinate variables and $\{p_i\}$ are the corresponding momenta.
\\[0.2cm]
If the system has total energy $E$, then the entropy $S$ of the system is given by
\begin{displaymath}
e^S ~ = ~ \int \delta(H-E)~dx_1dx_2...dx_Ndp_1dp_2...dp_N
\end{displaymath}
By investigating the properties of the Dirac delta function, obtain analytic formulae for $S$ as a 
function of $E$ and $N$. Show that
\begin{displaymath}
S ~ = ~ C(N) ~ + ~ (N-1) \log E
\end{displaymath}
where $C(N)$ is a constant dependent only on $N$.  Hence show that the entropy of the one-dimensional 
oscillator is independent of $E$. \\[0.2cm]
[Hint: Consider the special cases with $N$=1,2,3 respectively, before attempting the general case.]

\item
\underline{\large\bf Central quadric surfaces} \\[0.1cm]
The equation of a central quadric has the general form
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 a_{ij}(x_i - x_i^0)(x_j - x_j^0) = 1, \hspace*{0.5cm} a_{ji} = a_{ij}
\end{displaymath}
Classify these surfaces given that the determinant $|a_{ij}| \neq 0$.  \\[0.3cm]
Then consider the possible cases if $|a_{ij}|=0$. \\



\item
\underline{\large\bf Radiative transfer} \\[0.1cm]
The transfer of radiation through a star can be written
as the differential equation
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{\kappa_\lambda}\frac{{\rm d}I_\lambda}{{\rm d}s_\lambda}=
 -I_{\lambda}+S_\lambda
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $I_\lambda$ = radiation intensity at wavelength $\lambda$,
$\kappa_\lambda$ = absorption coefficient at $\lambda$, \linebreak[4]
${\rm d}s$ = path length,
$S_\lambda$ = source function.
Investigate the solution in the optically thin ($\tau_\lambda\ll 1$)
and optically thick ($\tau_\lambda\gg 1$)
limiting cases, with zero and non-zero starting values of $I_\lambda$.
\\[0.3cm]
\underline{Suggested reading}
\\
You may want to consult a text book on astrophysics for
more detailed background to this equation, eg. 
B\"{o}hm-Vitense, `Introduction to stellar astrophysics' vol. 2 (CUP, 1989). \\



\item
\underline{\large\bf Having a whale of a time}  \\[0.1cm]
The blue whale, the largest animal known to have lived on land or sea, was caught in large numbers
earlier this century and this resulted in a drastic decline in the size of the population.  
The blue whale is now officially a protected species.  However, it has been supposed that it will
become extinct in the near future because the number currently alive is so small that the males have a 
near impossible task of finding a mate. \\[0.2cm]
If the male and female populations, $M$ and $F$ respectively, are assumed, in the absence of encounters,
to decline at a rate proportional to the size of each population and the number of encounters is taken
to be proportional to $MF$, the equations determining $M$ and $F$ take the form
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{dM}{dt}~ = ~ - \alpha M ~ + ~ \beta MF
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{dF}{dt}~ = ~ - \eta F ~ + ~ \gamma MF
\end{displaymath}
where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\eta$ are positive constants. \\[0.2cm]
Analyse in detail the predictions this model makes about the behaviour of $M$ and $F$ with time.
Assign appropriate values to $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\eta$ and the values of $M$ abd $F$ at time
$t=0$, and use the equations to determine $M$ and $F$ at a sample range of subsequent times.  
Compare these results with any information you can obtain about the actual behaviour of the populations.
\\[0.2cm]
How would you modify the model to take into account
\begin{enumerate}
\item the effect of illegal whaling;
\item the limitation imposed on the population by the finite resources available to maintain the whales?
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
