%\underline{\large\bf The control of protein synthesis}  \\[0.1cm]
Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) plays a vital role in protein synthesis. It
carries the information which determines the structure of a protein to the
ribosomes, the spherical particles  on which protein synthesis occurs (see,
e.g., J.~D.~Watson, {\em Molecular Biology of the Gene}, Ch. 12 and 14).\\[6pt]
The simplest model for the control of protein synthesis is given by the
differential equations
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dY}{dt}&\!\!\! =\!\!\! & \frac{c}{a+bM}  -  kY, \\
\frac{dZ}{dt}&\!\!\! =\!\!\! & eY  - fZ, \\
\frac{dM}{dt}&\!\!\! =\!\!\! & gZ - hM ,
\end{eqnarray*}
where $Y$ is the concentration of the mRNA in the nucleus at time $t$ and
$Z$ is the concentration of the protein. The protein catalyses the production
of a repressor molecule, with concentration $M$, which prevents the
manufacture of mRNA, and $a$, $b$, $c$, $e$, $f$, $g$, $h$ and $k$ are positive
constants (see J.~Maynard Smith, {\em Mathematical Ideas in Biology},
p.\ 107 {\em et seq.}). \\[6pt]
Analyse in detail the predictions this model makes about the behaviour of $Y$,
$Z$ and $M$ with time. Consider any possible improvements that can be made to
the model.
