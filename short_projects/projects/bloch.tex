The Bloch equations for a magnetic resonance experiment
$$\frac{d {\bf M}}{dt}= - \gamma {\bf B}\times {\bf  M} -
({\bf M}-{\bf M}_0)/T$$
describe the time evolution of the magnetisation vector ${\bf M}(t)$ in the
presence of the magnetic field ${\bf B}$. Here the constant $\gamma$ is the
gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus, $T$ is the relaxation time, and
${\bf M}_0$ is the equilibrium magnetisation, assumed to be in the $z$
direction, ${\bf M}_0=(0,0,M_0)$.
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Determine the behaviour of the $x$, $y$ and $z$ components of the
magnetisation as a function of time
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[(a)] for ${\bf B}=(0,0,B_0)$ and ${\bf M}(0)=(M_0,0,0)$ (the
free precession experiment);
\item[(b)] for ${\bf B}=(0,0,B_0)$ and ${\bf M}(0)=(0,0,-M_0)$ (the
inversion recovery experiment).
\end{itemize}
\item In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, a weak radio frequency
magnetic field is applied in addition to the strong constant field, so that
${\bf B}=(B_1 \cos \omega t,-B_1 \sin \omega t,B_0)$.\\[6pt]
Transform the equations of motion to rotating axes ${\bf i'}= {\bf i}
\cos \omega t-{\bf j} \sin \omega t$, ${\bf j'}= {\bf j} \cos \omega t+{\bf i}
\sin \omega t$ and find expressions for the components of magnetisation
in these axes in the {\em steady state} (i.e., when the magnetisation is
constant in these rotating axes). Plot the ratio of three components of
magnetisation in the rotating axes to $M_0$ as a function of
$\omega / \gamma B_0$ assuming $T \gamma B_1 = 10^{-6}$ and $T \gamma B_0=100$.
\end{itemize}
