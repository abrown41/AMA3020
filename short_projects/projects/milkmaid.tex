\section{Two ships at anchor\\ \small{(%Pathway: Any; 
Pre-requisite: None)}}
% Milkmaid problem
Two ships, A and B, are at anchor some distance from each other and from 
shore. A boat launched from A takes a number of crew ashore and then sails
to B. What is the quickest path the boat can take?\\[6pt]
Start by considering the simplest case of a straight shoreline. Then consider
other shapes. Can you find equations that would solve the problem in the
general case?\\[6pt]
If you want to look at a more difficult problem, add a sea current parallel
to the shore!
