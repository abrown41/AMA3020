%\underline{\large\bf The error function} \\[0.1cm]
The function
\begin{displaymath}
\Phi(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^xe^{-t^2}dt
\end{displaymath}
occurs in discussions of many probabilistic phenomena, e.g., those involving
the normal distribution or diffusion processes. Most elementary statistics
texts will provide a set of values of $\Phi(x)$ tabulated at closely spaced
values of $x$.\\[6pt]
Investigate ways of evaluating this function to whatever accuracy you care
to specify, without recourse to such tables.
%Besides using numerical methods,
%think about determining approximate values of $\Phi(x)$ for small and large
%$x$ analytically.
