% Circles on a lattice
Consider all points with integer coordinates on the $xy$ plane, such as
$(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(-2,5)$, etc. These points form a
square lattice. A circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin may pass
through a number of lattice points for some values of $R$, while for others
it will pass through none. For example, for $R = \sqrt{2}$ the circle contains
four lattice points: $(\pm 1,\pm 1)$, but for $R = 3/2$ no lattice points lie
on the circle.\\[6pt]
It is easy to see that for a circle to contain any lattice points, its
radius must be the square root of a natural number, i.e., $R=\sqrt{n}$,
where $n\in \mathbb{N}$. However, this condition is not sufficient, e.g.,
the circle with $R =\sqrt{3}$ contains no lattice points, while that with
$R=\sqrt{5}$ contains a few (how many?).\\[6pt]
Investigate this problem. The aim is to find out as much as possible about
the number of lattice points that a circle may pass through, as a function of
$n$. In particular, can we say anything about the {\em average} number of
lattice points per circle?
