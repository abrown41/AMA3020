%\underline{\large\bf Modelling walking through a pendulum model} \\[0.1cm]
In biomechanics and robotics, walking is often modelled through
an (inverted) pendulum model. Walking is most energy efficient when
gravity dominates the movement of the legs. Under this assumption,
estimate the normal speed of walking. How would the model change
when the model of a leg is extended to include a foot or a knee?
