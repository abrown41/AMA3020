A wire of unit length is cut into two pieces, which are formed into the shape
of a circle and a square respectively.  Show that the sum of the two areas so
formed is a minimum when
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\mbox{area of circle}}{\mbox{area of square}} =
\frac{\mbox{perimeter of circle}}{\mbox{perimeter of square}}
\end{displaymath}
\item What about other shapes? More pieces? Etc.
\end{itemize}
