%\underline{\large\bf The rigid rocking pendulum} \\[0.1cm]
A rigid pendulum, such as a long rod, has a short cross-bar rigidly attached
to it. As it oscillates in a vertical plane, it is supported on the ends of
the cross-bar as they alternately contact a fixed horizontal surface.

If the pendulum is at rest in equilibrium when it is given a small angular
speed $\omega_0$, determine the interval of time between consecutive returns
to the equilibrium position. Are these intervals constant,
or functions of time? Alternatively, the motion can be started by tilting the
pendulum by an angle $\theta _0$ and releasing it from rest. What is the
time between subsequent maximum tilt positions? You can assume that the
oscillations are small.
