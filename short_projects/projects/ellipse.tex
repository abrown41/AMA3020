\section{Ellipse and its normals\\ \small{(%Pathway: Any; 
Pre-requisite: None)}}
An ellipse can be defined by its equation in Cartesian coordinates
$$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1,$$
where $a$ and $b$ ($b\leq a$) are its semimajor and semiminor axes,
respectively. Alternatively, it can be defined in the parametric form by
$x=a\cos t$, $y=b\sin t$, $0\leq t\leq 2\pi$.\\[6pt]
How many {\em normals} to the ellipse can you draw from a given point in the
$xy$ plane? [The normal is a line perpendicular to the tangent at the point
where it meets the curve.]
